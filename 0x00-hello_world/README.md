0x00. C - Hello, World
Welcome to the first project of the C programming series. In this project, we will explore the basics of C programming, including writing our first C program, understanding the compilation process, and getting familiar with basic syntax and structure. This foundational knowledge will set the stage for more advanced concepts and projects in C.
